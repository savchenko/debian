# Laptop

Configures Debian installation to be used on a laptop. 

## Notes

The playbook distinguishes between AMD/Intel systems, but does assume the following:
- User has non-free repository enabled and OK with installing binary firmware blobs.
- Laptop has some sort of Realtek audio codec.
- WiFi is provided by Intel chip irrespective of CPU vendor.

### S3/S4

Hibernation is disabled in kernel when system is booted in "lockdown" mode. This is the case when SecureBoot is enabled.

There is a patchset that might allow functional and secure hibernation in future: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210220013255.1083202-1-matthewgarrett@google.com/T/#u

### i2c

To control external screens via DDC/CI, `ddcutil` is using i2c bus. You need to either add user to i2c group or `sudo` the call.

## Requirements

Ansible â‰¥2.9  
Debian 11 (might work on its derivatives, however this is not guaranteed)
